Could what you believe about yourself impact your success or failure? According to Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, your beliefs play a pivotal role in what you want and whether you achieve it. 
Dweck has found that it is your mindset that plays a significant role in determining achievement and success. So, what exactly is a mindset?

## What Is a Mindset?

Your mindset is a set of beliefs that shape how you make sense of the world and yourself. It influences how you think, feel, and behave in any given situation.
### Types

According to Dweck, there are two basic mindsets: fixed and growth. If you have a fixed mindset, you believe your abilities are fixed traits and therefore can't be changed. You may also believe that your talent and intelligence alone leads to success, and effort is not required.

On the flipside, if you have a growth mindset, you believe that your talents and abilities can be developed over time through effort and persistence. People with this mndset don't necessarily believe that everyone can become Einstein or Mozart just because they try. They do, however, believe that everyone can get smarter or more talented if they work at it.

Here are some fixed vs. growth mindset examples.

Fixed Mindset: Either I’m good at it or I’m not
Growth Mindset:

| Fixed Mindset      | Growth Mindset |
|      :----:       |    :----:   |  
| Either I’m good at it or I’m not.| I can learn to do anything I want.|
| That's just who I am. I can't change it.| I'm a constantly evolving work in progress.|
| If you have to work hard, you don't have the ability.| The more you challenge yourself, the smarter you become.|
| If I don’t try, then I won’t fail.| I only fail when I stop trying.|
| That job position is totally out of my league.| That job position looks challenging. Let me apply for it.|
